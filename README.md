NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .NET languages. Initially ported from JUnit, the current production release, version 3.0, has been completely rewritten with many new features and support for a wide range of .NET platforms.

This repository contains the SilverLight 5.0 version of the NUnit Framework. More information can be found in the main [NUnit Framework repository](https://github.com/nunit/nunit) and in the [documentation](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki).
